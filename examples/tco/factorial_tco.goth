# Factorial - TAIL RECURSIVE with accumulator
# The recursive call is in tail position

# Pattern: recursive_call with accumulated product  ← IS tail recursive
#
# Precondition: n >= 0
# Postcondition: result = n!

# factAcc n acc - compute n! with accumulator
# De Bruijn: ₁ = n (countdown), ₀ = acc (running product)
