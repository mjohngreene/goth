# Sum 1 to N - TAIL RECURSIVE with accumulator
# The recursive call is in tail position

# Pattern: recursive_call with accumulated sum  ← IS tail recursive

# Precondition: n >= 0
# Postcondition: result = n(n+1)/2

# sumAcc n acc - sum from n down to 1
# De Bruijn: ₁ = n (countdown), ₀ = acc (running sum)
